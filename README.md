# flutter_todo

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

If you have cloned it already, you can run it immediately (assuming you have already installed Flutter and Dart).

The PIN for accessing the application is '120542'.

This app consists of a main page with three functions: TODO, DOING, DONE. Each page contains 10 items and loads more data if there are still ITEMS remaining in the API. The functionality of each Card item is such that you can click on the card to view details of the item, and you can slide to delete the item.
